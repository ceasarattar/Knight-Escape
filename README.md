# Knight Escape: A Chess Puzzle Game

## This GitHub repository hosts a C++ program called "Knight Escape," a puzzle game based on chess mechanics where the player needs to move a white knight to a specific position on the board. Utilizing standard chess knight moves, players must navigate the knight in L-shaped patterns to reach the target square while avoiding black knights and optimizing the number of moves to maintain a high score.

### Game Objective
 * Your goal is to move the white knight to the empty square in the upper-right corner of the board (position 5).
 * The knight should move according to standard chess rules, specifically in an L-shape: two squares in one direction followed by one square perpendicular to the first direction,    or vice versa.
 * The board is populated with black knights, which are static obstacles.
 * Each valid move decreases your score by 5 points, and each invalid move decreases it by 10 points. Start with a score of 500 and aim to keep it as high as possible.
